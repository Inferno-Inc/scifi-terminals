# Scifi Terminals

Using [charmbracelet/vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs#hide) to recreate some classic sci-fi movie terminals


# Fonts

I'm not a font geek, but have resorted to googling and best guessing to try and use the right fonts for the different 
terminal sessions. Here's the list I used. 

If you think you have a better suggestion then file an issue and I'll take a look!

Check the `Set FontFamily` instructions in the `.tape` files to see how they're set.
